          <h1> Art School "Stop Out" </h1>
          <p class="post-info"> Pratt Institute of Art, Brooklyn | Circa, 2002-03; 2004-05 </p>
          <br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4466/format:webp/1*kY6yg0chz7Puu-WgrlYNMA.jpeg"><br>
          <p> I didn’t graduate from college. I couldn’t afford it. Pratt Institute of Art was expensive, and loans or financial aid were simply out of reach {though not as simple as it may seem}. At nineteen years old, there wasn’t much that I could afford, so I worked in construction and demolition, at the bowling alley, the hardware store, the grocery store, and at the gas station.
            At this point, I was already in my twenties, without a degree and with zero applicable skills beyond what I could [“bull”-expletive] with my so-called ‘talent’.

          <h1> Doings of an Autodidact</h1>
          <p class="post-info"> Pennsylvania suburbia | Circa, 2002-03; 2004-05 </p>

          <br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4096/format:webp/1*ZpyOMlmzMa0rPlNY--3KXA.png"><br>
          <p>I built my first computer {circa 2005–’06}. I immediately installed pirated copies of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. While I didn’t study at university, I studied what I saw. Whatever piqued my interest, I looked at, intensely.
          </p
          <br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*h9ljVOzzRT-IrakgaDSWvQ.png"><br>
          <p>So, without a college degree, or any equivalent experience, I started from absolute scratch. I studied typography {reading books, examining magazines, and generally observing what I saw wherever I were}. I studied color theory and sought online tutorials that taught me how to master the tools I had at my disposal {my clandestinely acquired Adobe products}.</p>
          <br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*puHZ09ELFPd-AaMK0HAxqQ.png"><br>
          <p>I began to create faux website concepts to gain an understanding of designing for that medium — as the screenshot above may suggest, I had lots to learn.</p>
          <br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*lm5BUxr0dDq73bWoi3vy4w.png"><br>
          <p>All this culminated with an interview and subsequent job offer from Xoxide Incorporated {later turned Turn5 Inc.} which was the parent company to a number of niche e-commerce businesses operating in a variety of verticals {Beauty, Automotive, Tech}. I found their company through a Craigslist post in the web / design category. I can still pull up my original cover letter {which I just looked at and am considering reusing in my current job search endeavors}.</p>

          <p>Alright. Now, where to begin? {circa 2007 through 2011}</p>
<br>
<p>Okay, so I’ve just been brought into the fold with a budding home-grown startup. The company had set up its new HQ at a warehouse office facility in Great Valley, PA {~20 miles outside of Philly}, and was owned and operated by two brothers; one of which wasn’t even old enough to drink at the company holiday party.

I had been provided a brand new PC replete with a dual-screen monitor setup and a Canon Rebel DSLR with a kit lens.

I think it’s easier to list all my roles and functions via bulleted list:

          <p> Product Photographer & Image Manipulation specialist; covering all manner of product photography; specializing in lighting, establishing systematic product photography protocols {for visual uniformity at scale}, photo-retouching, as well as requiring technical product knowledge and scrutinizing attention to detail.</p>

          <p> Graphic Designer turned Web Designer; responsible for feature development with a specific focus on user experience through wireframe prototyping, user testing, and data-backed solutioning [sic].</p>
          <br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*m7HfhuQO4Ugr1VteZf6itA.png"><br>
          <p><strong>In many respects, Turn5 Inc. served as my formal education.</strong><br><br>

I learned first and foremost how to work within a team environment, where everyone’s role was crucial towards the company’s success.

There, I learned the ins-and-outs and nuance to graphic design, product photography and related production processes, email and display ad marketing, printed packaging and catalogs, and in the latter half of my nearly four years there, served as a web designer focused on user experience — by the books — as applied to a {then} forty-million per year ecommerce giant born from a garage somewhere in the suburbs of southeastern Pennsylvania.</p>

          <h2>Okay, so Leadnomics was shifty. 👀 Paradigm shifty, we’ll say.</h2>
          <p> It was a great place to work though. I have lasting friendships with folks I worked with there {heck, two of them now work at Google}. But our work fed upon the uneducated and disenfranchised, in some respects. As the name may suggest, our focus was in lead generation. Our cash cow was in facilitating easy access to high-interest short-term loans {otherwise known as payday loans}.

          <p>But, we had free lunches, regular bonuses, company outings, free snacks, and solid benefits; each with our own super thin Apple laptops and the ability to WFH occasionally {circa 2011, fyi}.</p>

          <p>In short, my job was to make it intuitive and stress free {daresay pleasant} for one {user} to make catastrophic financial decisions {under clandestine duress} at a scale in tens of thousands per month.</p>

          <p> One Sixty Over Ninety — my heart rate when I was offered a full-time gig as an “Interaction Designer” {circa 2014} working at a leading design agency at the literal epicenter of Center City, Philadelphia.

Here, it was less about impressing our clients. Here, it was all about working with our clients.

Without the pizazz of beautiful grayscale renders of your soon-to-be colored in homepage, we focused on asking the right questions and getting the right ‘feel’ with our clients. We were agile in nature and scrum led; we had daily scrums and weekly sprint schedules. We dealt with client feedback organically, and responsively, as opposed to reactively.</p>

          <p>I had mentioned Agile and Scrum. Well, say hello to Gidget, our adjunct project manager and scrum master at Workarea {a proprietary SaaS e-commerce platform}.
<br><br>
Here, I served as a Senior Visual and UX Designer. Here, we did wireframes differently. Here, we worked in direct partnership with our ever-ready-to-help developers. Napkin sketches, low-fi mockups, or just a few messages on Slack were all that was needed.
<br><br>
The work was building out our proprietary SaaS E-commerce Platform which we marketed out in typical agency-style to a number of A-list brands, using all insights and analytics towards optimizing our platform and expanding functionality to meet demand.

I don’t have any work to show from here. I didn’t save any of my napkins.</p>

          <p> FlightPath presented an intriguing opportunity. Recently emerging from the brink of bankruptcy, the agency had drastically downsized from a bustling office to a sparse handful of core employees. It wasn’t a lucrative endeavor; the pay was passable at best. But for me, the allure lay in the chance to immerse myself in the New York agency scene and gather invaluable experience to propel my career forward.
<br><br>
Despite its tumultuous journey, FlightPath managed to preserve vital relationships with long-standing clients, specifically in the pharmaceutical sector {Merck, Zoetis, Charter, and Goya}. Operating in regulated industries, these clients demanded design solutions that not only adhered to WCAG 2.0 AA {or even AAA} compliance standards but also underwent rigorous scrutiny and approval from legal and regulatory marketing authorities. </p>

<p>This non-profit client only had a $20K budget. Look at what I gave them for $20K. I can’t show any of my Merck work due to NDA.

          <h2>Cards against bad UX? What?</h2>
          <p>What do you do when you’re working with a sophisticated client, who has a tremendously complex product line and deep inventory, who are accustomed to B2B and B2E operations and dealings, and whom while fluent with their industry acumen, were completely unfamiliar with “the design process”[?]</p>

          <p>What do you do when jargon-laden spreadsheets and single-sided meetings net nothing but frustration with the client to the point where they’re considering abandoning the contract?</p>

          <h2>Enter "Cards Against Bad UX"</h2>
          <p>All I did was ‘simplify what we asked’; to shift the conversation away from technical jargon and towards user-centric thinking. By providing different perspectives such as “As a shopper” “As a content manager” or “As a guest user”, and pairing it with a simple visual {a card}, I was able to help our stakeholders empathize with their end-users and focus on their needs and experiences.
<br><br>

This approach not only catalyzed communication but also encouraged collaboration and problem-solving from both sides of the table. It allowed our client to see the project from various angles and find common ground, ultimately leading to more effective solutions and preventing frustration or contract abandonment.</p>

          <p>At LiveArea, I was the UX Manager assigned to contracts exceeding $1m in value {$1.2m, actually}. My hourly billable rate to the client was something like $235/hr. Everything I did had a direct impact on the final deliverable.
<br>
<br>
I managed multiple projects and pitches as well as junior designers while being the primary client-facing resource. I presented findings. I course-corrected when needed. I moved the machine forward.</p>
          <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*UATKEet6VtcLkA8rYspjFQ.png"><br>    
          <p> At Huge, I couldn’t tell you what my billable rate was, but I could say this was the first time I had seen a project with at least 20 different people involved {on just the agency side}.
<br>
<br>
At Huge, I was responsible for exploring a single user flow. There were other designers responsible for exploring other individual user flows. At no point during my time with Huge did I even know there were other designers on that project. To say we were siloed would be a gross understatement.
<br>
<br>
Being completely candid, I get it. This was a mere contract position. Huge hired numerous UX contractors to sign on few weeks or months. It was simply about a little bit of work done without any long-term commitments.
<br>
<br>
I would be thrilled to take on a more robust contract, but hopefully with a different {and more vested manager this time around}. Or, may I be the manager? ;) </p>

          <p> I interviewed for an ‘ACD, Interactive’ position and was immediately hired on a freelance basis as a Senior Designer, with the intention of fulfilling the ACD responsibilities. As part of the team working on a project for a top social media brand, I quickly proved my worth and was transitioned to full-time employment.</p>

          <p>The project was led by a Directly Responsible Individual (DRI), but whom accepted a Director-level position {elsewhere} three months into the project. There were also the departure of several key team members {including senior strategists and technologists}, which placed additional responsibilities on my shoulders, requiring me to provide guidance in UX, Strategy, and Development, while also serving as a people manager myself with a junior-level associate under my purview. </p>

          <p>Besides resourcing hurdles, there were issues spanning practicality and pragmatism, suffice to say.
<br><br>
Despite offering to improve internal education initiatives and providing proactive feedback {submitting a ‘post mortem’, as requested}, I was let go from Code & Theory without explanation. It was a challenging experience, but one that taught me valuable lessons about the realities of working in a large agency environment.</p>

          <p>My passion for creative output is unrelenting, though I’m using different parts of my brain to make due. I still have my eyes set on elevating my career in a paradigm changing way.

         <p>Meanwhile, got mouths to feed.</p><br>

<p>As an aside, I’ve been keeping up with the latest happenings in the world of “Artificial Intelligence”. I am absolutely unequivocally NOT worried about the ‘thinking machines’ taking over jobs, or the world for that matter.

AI will never have the patience required (nor physical dexterity) to run and terminate physical ethernet cables or fiber optic lines. Never.
